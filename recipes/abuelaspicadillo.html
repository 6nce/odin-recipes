        <h1>Abuella's Picadillo</h1>
        <img src="../images/picadillo.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is my grandmother's Cuban picadillo (ground beef hash/chili) recipe which is usually served with white rice, beans and plantains. 
            Picadillo also goes great with mashed potatoes and can be made without the squash. 
            This dish is a favorite at home so I usually make 2 pounds to have leftovers for making empanadas (meat pies) the next day. Picadillo also freezes well. 
            Of course my kids say this is the best picadillo they've ever had and I have to agree!
